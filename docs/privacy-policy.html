    <h1>Kakeibo Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 15 February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Kakeibo is a personal budgeting app. Your financial data stays on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter (income, expenses, savings goals, reflections) is stored locally on your device using an on-device database. Nothing is sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>The app makes network requests solely to download fonts from Google Fonts. No personal or financial data is included in these requests. Google's privacy policy for this service is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>Kakeibo does not include any analytics, crash reporting, advertising, or tracking of any kind.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Kakeibo does not integrate with any third-party services other than Google Fonts as described above.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the app removes all your data. There is nothing to delete on our end.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Kakeibo does not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted on this page with a revised date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy, please <a href="https://github.com/bradymd/kakeibo/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
