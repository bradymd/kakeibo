# Kakeibo

A mindful budgeting app inspired by the Japanese art of **Kakeibo** (家計簿) — the household financial ledger tradition created by journalist Hani Motoko in 1904.

Rather than just tracking expenses, Kakeibo encourages you to pause and reflect on *why* you spend, helping you develop a healthier relationship with money.

## Features

**The Four Pillars of Spending**
Every expense is categorised into one of four pillars, the foundation of the Kakeibo method:
- **Needs** (必要) — Essentials like groceries, utilities, transport
- **Wants** (欲しい) — Enjoyable but non-essential purchases
- **Culture** (文化) — Self-enrichment like books, courses, museums
- **Unexpected** (予想外) — Unforeseen costs like repairs or medical bills

**Monthly Budgeting**
- Multiple income sources
- Savings goal setting
- Visual budget bar showing savings, available funds, and spending
- Fixed costs management with category support

**Expense Tracking**
- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Search across all months
- Swipe between dashboard, expenses, and fixed costs
- Import fixed costs from previous months

**End-of-Month Reflection**
- Guided reflection with four questions to review your spending
- See whether you hit your savings goal
- Track improvement strategies month to month

**Customisation**
- Multi-currency support (GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, and more)
- Renameable expense categories
